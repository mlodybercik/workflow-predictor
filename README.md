# workflow-predictor
Team Engineering Project, project for Credit Suisse (rip). ("""Team""", backend and research made only by me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

## What does it do?
This project aims to create an tool for predicting time of DAG, action on node, workflows by predicting the time of each node and choosing the longest path to given node. This tool can:
- create different kind of prediction models in very granular way used for time estimation,
- serve an API that can be used to query given node in given workflow to get the time estimation.

## Who is this for?

If you deal with long task pipelines that take different amounts of time based on some given apriori parameters and you want to have an app that can be used to at least get an estimation based on current state of execution graph, then it's for you.

**This implementation does not take into account execution times of other nodes. We assume that the time does not depend on execution time of previous nodes but only on submitted parameters** (input data could be structured in that way that could take those values into consideration, but API isn't ready for that in any way), we also assume that time between tasks (if all of the predecessors end) is insignificant.



## Development
This project uses `pipenv` so it's the first and most important thing you'll need. I use python 3.9, because of my addiction to walrus `:=` and some QOL methods in standard library. `Tensorflow` is locked to `2.11` because of my old GPU I have in my homelab that accelerates the Deep Learning part of the project. Project is mainly built to be run in Linux Docker containers, but there is option for baremetal. I use `pre-commit` for code quality maintainment.
To set the environment up:
```bash
python3 -m pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
pre-commit install
```

## Starting
### Learning
To start the learning process you have to have the files provided by Credit Suisse, but the code is (almost) made for accepting any kind of properly formatted data (maybe in the future, I'll make a propper source-agnostic data format). You shoud have:
- files describing some kind of a workflow, (directed acyclic graph to be precise with action on node, not on an edge)
- raw input data (as I said above, maybe in the future I'll change format of the input data to be more standard'ish cos for now only data we have is kinda private from Credit Suisse)

Place them into `data/` directory, and run `python scripts/make.py`. It'll format and extract all the data we need for learning process.

Next, we have to start the learning process. We can - in very granular way - change how we process each task by passing different basic parameters to learning script `... learn --batch 8 --epochs 15 --job <job-name>`, or we could change more advanced settings like model shape, the optimizer or time mapping functions by editing `learn/model_mapping.py` file (you could even use convolution if you really wanted to). After the deep learning stage, model is serialized with all the neccesary data to convert mapped time back into real time used in estimation.

Before the deep learning stage, every parameter for each task (separately) is checked, how does it influence the mean execution time of that perticular task. We generate list of parameter keys sorted by resulting mean with that perticular parameter value. Each value in that list gets assigned number from -1 to 1. (-1 when average is the lowest for that parameter and 1 for max) and we give those values to inputs of each model (**if some parameter has not been seen with a given task, we assume that it doesn't influence the mean execution time**). This could be good for lots of parameters that hugely influence the mean value, but not necessarily when having lots of similar values and then few outliers. This could be easily dealt with though.

#### Script usage:
By default, it will search for neccesary files inside the `data/` directory, you could invoke the script with `-h` to get all of the learning params.

`python src/app.py -d <destination> learn -b 8 -e 20 -p -j open-date-card`

### Backend
After getting yourself trained or pretrained models you can start the API. You will need these models alongside the workflows definitions to start the backend. By default it looks for directories in `/tmp/` that contain the graph definitions and model definitions. (`/tmp/workflows/` and `/tmp/models/`). Inside the first one it looks for `.yml` files with propper structure (in the future‚Ñ¢ ill make the structure more standard), and in the second one, it looks for custom `.wfp` files with model definitions.

To start the backend server:
- if you use Docker: `docker compose build`, `docker compose up` and to tear down, `docker compose down`
- if you don't use Docker or you are prototyping and don't want to rebuild the image every 15 seconds: `python src/app.py`.

#### Script usage:
`TASK_COLUMNS_LOCATION=data/task-columns.yml MODEL_DEFINITIONS_LOCATION=../workflow-models/ python src/app.py serve`

### API
Backend creates *single* endpoint for every workflow definition `<workflow-name>/predict/<target-node>/` used for communication.

Request structure is as follows:
```json
{
    "processing": {
        // currently executing nodes, we pass the task identifier (its name) as a key
        // and epoch time of the beggining as value
        "make-a-sandwich": 1112729820
    },
    "done": {
        // same as the above, but epoch time of finishing the task
        "task-a": 1112729800,
        "task-b": 1112729700
    },
    "parameters": {
        // we pass all of the parameters for given task here with key as its name and value as its value
        // you can skip parameters for tasks that are done, they wont be used to predict either way
        "make-a-sandwich": {"param-a": 72, "param-b": "with_bread"}
    }
}
```
#### Example
```bash
$ curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '<big-json-here>' http://localhost:5000/strategic-flow/predict/reload-b3-tables/
{"path": ["node1", "node2", ..., "nodeN_in_path"], "timedelta": 2137.69420}
```
